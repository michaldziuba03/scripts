## Shell Scripts and setups
Scripts for my UNIX based machines. I try to make each script work on any major Linux distro.

### Some personal rules for writing scripts I try to apply
- use common programs to avoid additional dependencies
- try to make it POSIX compilant
- can be run from any place on your system - it shouldn't result with output files in your current directory

### Install Nerd Fonts
Nerd fonts are essential part of my every Linux setup. They I required by many fancy configs for shell or text editors. Script just install my favourite nerd fonts.

### Install Neovim
Neovim is just Vim but better. I like to use Neovim for Rust programming, Shell scripting and editing configs on my system. I use this script only for distros with outdated neovim version in repository (Ubuntu, Debian). On Arch based distros I install neovim just with `pacman`.

### Install NvChad from official website
I don't really want to spend my time on mantaining own config for Neovim (I used to spend). Among many configs for neovim around - NvChad is my favourite.

1. Install Nerd fonts
2. Install Neovim
3. [Copy single command from official docs](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install)
